# My n8n Automation Learning Journey

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Johnny.

This repository serves as my personal logbook and portfolio as I delve into the world of workflow automation using the powerful open-source platform, **n8n**. As an Information Security student, I'm particularly interested in how automation can enhance efficiency and potentially be applied in security contexts, while also exploring its broader applications.

## Why This Repository?

My primary motivations for creating and maintaining this repository are:

- **Deepen Understanding:** To solidify my grasp of n8n's capabilities, its various nodes, and the core concepts of workflow automation.
- **Build Practical Projects:** To create hands-on automation projects that solve small real-world problems or address personal productivity needs.
- **Share the Process:** To document and share my learning journey â€“ including successes and challenges â€“ with the community (#LearnInPublic).
- **Develop a Portfolio:** To build a tangible collection of projects showcasing my growing skills in automation.

## Repository Structure

You'll find this repository organized into subdirectories, each representing a specific n8n automation project. Inside each project folder, you can typically expect:

- `workflow.json`: The exported n8n workflow file, ready to be imported.
- `README.md`: A detailed explanation of the project's goal, how the workflow operates, setup instructions, and key takeaways.
- Supporting files (screenshots, sample data, etc.) where applicable.

## Projects

Here's a list of the projects documented in this repository:

- **[Project 01: Name of Project 1]**: [Brief one-sentence description] - (Link to project directory)
- **[Project 02: Name of Project 2]**: Not Yet
- _(More projects will be added as I progress!)_
